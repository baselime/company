Boris is the founder and CEO of [Baselime](https://baselime.io), an observability platform for serverless applications.

Before this, he graduated in Physics and Aerospace Engineering and worked on back-end systems and infrastructure at multiple startups. During these years he was drawn to cloud-native and serverless technologies, and always ended up being the guardian of the logging and monitoring systems in the teams he joined.

As founder and CEO of [Baselime](https://baselime.io), he's applying his years of experience to introduce engineering teams to Observability as Code, such that they discover bugs before their users do. Boris is active on Twitter ([@boristane](https://twitter.com/boristane)) and is building a team of talented professionals excited about the future of cloud computing.
