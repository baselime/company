# About Baselime

**Continuous Observability for Serverless Architectures**

Baselime is re-imagining how developers build and maintain their serverless applications. We enable serverless-native developers to discover bugs before thier users do, letting them escape the chaos of managing observability resources through point-and-click graphical user interfaces with our Observability as Code capabilities.
